        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is a classic Italian sub sandwich with three kinds of meat and provolone cheese. The kind you get in a mom and pop pizza joint. You'll be glad you tried it!
        </p>
        <h2>ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 medium fresh tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>1 medium red onion, chopped</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white wine vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>

                Shred potatoes into a large bowl filled with cold water. Stir until water is cloudy; drain and cover potatoes again with fresh cold water. Stir again to dissolve excess starch. Drain potatoes well, pat dry with paper towels, and squeeze out any excess moisture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat clarified butter in a large nonstick pan over medium heat. Sprinkle shredded potatoes into hot butter in an even layer; season with cayenne pepper, paprika, salt, and black pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook potatoes until a brown crust forms on the bottom, about 5 minutes. Flip or stir and continue to cook until potatoes are browned and crusty all over, about 5 more minutes.
